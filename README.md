Testing and Refactoring JavaScript
===

A Pair Programming Exercise by [OKC WebDevs](https://okcweb.dev)

## How to Use this Repo - Refactoring

Explore the `before` directory, and run the code there:
```
node before/index.js
```

Now see how you can refactor it. The purpose of the main function is to
accept a list of positive numbers, sum them, and increase them by a tax rate of
8% for a final price.

When you're ready and want to check how we refactored things, check out the
`after` directory.

To run the code there:
```
node after/index.js
```

## How to Use this Repo - Testing

There is a simple Jest test set up for the refactored code. To set up the test
environment:
```
cd after
npm install
```


To run the test suite:

```
npm run test
```
